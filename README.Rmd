# AquacropOnR

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of AquacropOnR is to make AquaCrop simulations from within `R` as easy as possible. The package has currently been tested with the AquaCrop standalone version 7.0 on Windows. The most recent version can be downloaded from the [FAO website](https://www.fao.org/aquacrop/software/aquacropplug-inprogramme/en/#c518670).

## Installation and setup

First install [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
Then you can install the development version of `AquacropOnR` using the `devtools` package:

``` r
library(devtools)
devtools::install_git(url = "https://github.com/tdeswaef/aquacroponr.git", force = TRUE)
```

The installation of the AquaCrop standalone version is required.


## Roadmap

- [x] definition of the AquaCrop wrapper function `aquacrop_wrapper`  
- [x] allow option to run AquaCrop on growing degree days instead of days  
- [x] include code for running sensitivity analysis using the morris method
